# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset often used for learning and practicing data analysis techniques. It contains various attributes of passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographic information and survival outcomes.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **main.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data cleaning and EDA.
- **titanic.csv**: Dataset file (not included in this repository).

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Load the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values in the 'Age' and 'Embarked' columns.
   - Drop unnecessary columns like 'Cabin'.
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generate summary statistics.
   - Visualize distributions of variables such as 'Age', 'Fare', and categorical variables like 'Pclass' and 'Sex'.
   - Explore relationships between variables using plots such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots.
   - Analyze survival rates based on passenger attributes like class, age, gender, etc.
   - Compute correlations between variables.
   
4. **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and insights from the analysis.
